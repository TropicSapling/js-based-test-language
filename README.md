# js-based-test-language
Successor of PBTL.

Will be written in itself in the end, but for now I'll write it in JS because it's faster than Python but about as easy. It will build upon C and be completely compatible. (So you can use this compiler to compile C files, but no use really since this compiler will only compile to C first and then use the C compiler to compile to executable code)
